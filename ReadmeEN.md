 🔑  RNS Identity Manager & Monitor 🌐
</h1>

A comprehensive web interface for managing Reticulum (RNS) identities and real-time monitoring of network announces.

<h3> 📋 Overview</h3>

![RNID_GUI](img/rnidGUI.jpg)

This project provides an intuitive web interface for:
- **Managing RNS identities** (create, import, export, view)
- **Monitoring RNS announces** in real-time with advanced filtering
- **Executing RNS commands** (rnstatus, rnpath, rnprobe) through a graphical interface
- **Encrypting/decrypting** files and text with RNS identities
- **Signing and verifying** files digitally

<h3> ✨ Features</h3>

### Identity Manager
- ✅ Display all RNS identities (reticulum, nomadnet, lxmf, rnphone, meshchat)
- ✅ Import/export identities in HEX, Base32, Base64 formats
- ✅ Generate new identities
- ✅ Hash verification and analysis (public identities)
- ✅ Aspect hash calculation for RNS destinations
- ✅ File and text encryption/decryption
- ✅ Digital signing and signature verification (.rsg)

    ~/.rns_manager/storage/

Cache and downloads:

    ~/.rns_manager/Cache/ - Announce and identity cache

    ~/.rns_manager/Downloads/ - Processed files


<h3>🎮 Usage</h3>

Identity Manager

    Load identities: Press "Load" to display found identities

    Select identity: Click on an identity to select it

    Operations:

        ℹ️ Identity Info - View details

        📢 Announce - Announce an aspect

        Import/Export - Manage identities in various formats

        Generate - Create new identities

![RNID_GUI](img/rnsMonitor2.jpg)


Aspect Monitor

    Live view: View real-time announces

    Filters: Filter by aspect, search text, sort

    Identities: Analyze per-identity statistics

    Statistics: Charts and counters

    Click on hashes to open modal with commands:

        🛣️ rnpath - View path

        📡 rnprobe - Send probe

        🕳️ rnpath -p - Check blackhole

<h3>🔧 Configuration</h3>

Identity Cache

Identities are cached for 5 minutes for optimal performance. To force a full scan, press "Deep Scan".
Announce Cache

Announces are automatically saved every 60 seconds and kept for 7 days in ~/.rns_manager/Cache/announce_cache.json.
Path Customization

Modify USER_DIRECTORIES in manager.py to add/remove search directories.

<h3>🐛 Known Issues</h3>

    Initial identity scan may take 10-30 seconds with many identities

    Some aspects might not be correctly recognized

    On mobile devices, some tables may require horizontal scrolling


<h3>🔜 Roadmap</h3>

    Multi-language support

    Statistics export to CSV/JSON

    Identity group management

    Nomad Network integration for messaging

    Authentication and multi-user support

    Dark/light mode toggle


<h3>📦 Dependencies</h3>

    Flask >= 2.0.0

    Reticulum (rns) >= 0.5.0

    Python >= 3.7


<h3>⚙️ Advanced Configuration</h3>
Cache Duration

You can modify cache duration in rns_manager.py:

```ini
Identity cache (default: 6 hours)
identity_cache = IdentityCache(cache_duration=3600)

Announce cache (default: 7 days)
announce_cache = PersistentAnnounceCache(
    max_age_days=7,
    save_interval=60
)
```

Adding Custom Aspects

Edit RNS_ASPECTS list in rns_manager.py and rns_monitor.html to add custom aspects for recognition.


<h3>🖥️ System Requirements</h3>
<p>
    RAM: Minimum 256MB, recommended 512MB
    Storage: 100MB for logs and cache
    CPU: Any modern processor
    Network: Reticulum-compatible interface
</p>

<h3>📈 Performance Tips</h3>
<p>
    First scan will be slow; subsequent loads use cache
    Limit aspects in RNS_ASPECTS for faster identity scanning
    Use "Load from cache" for instant results
    Clear cache periodically to free disk space
</p>

<h3>🆘 Troubleshooting</h3>

Q: Identities not showing up?
A: Check if paths in USER_DIRECTORIES are correct and contain valid 64-byte identity files.

Q: Monitor shows no announces?
A: Verify Reticulum is running and network interfaces are active.

Q: Cache not working?
A: Ensure ~/.rns_manager/Cache directory is writable.

Q: rnid commands failing?
A: Make sure rnid is installed and in your PATH.
